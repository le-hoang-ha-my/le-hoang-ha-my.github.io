## Literature

I love reading, and the classics Iâ€™ve read over the years have had a profound impact on my understanding of the world. Literature has given me a more holistic and empathetic worldview, enriching my perspective on human nature and the complexities of life. I am continually moved by the power of words - the way mere sentences can evoke vivid imagery and stir deep emotions. Beyond this, I believe books serve as vessels for the minds and souls of those who came before us. They preserve the consciousness of past generations and pass it forward to posterity, perpetuating the development of humankind not only in knowledge but also in spirit, allowing writers to live on through their works. Some of my favorite authors across genres and eras include **Fyodor Dostoyevsky**, **Alexandre Dumas**, **J.R.R. Tolkien**, **William Shakespeare**, **Edgar Allan Poe**, and **Agatha Christie**, among many others.
