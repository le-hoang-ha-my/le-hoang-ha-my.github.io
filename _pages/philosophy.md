## Philosophy

Alongside mathematics, I believe philosophy is one of the most foundational fields of human inquiry. It teaches us how to think, and thus influences how we approach everything else. As a kid, I was left completely awestruck by the seemingly magical fact that something as material as the brain can give rise to something as enigmatic and immaterial as consciousness. It is equally wondrous to think about how anything even exists at all, and how it all started, if there was ever a beginning in the first place. Given this brief and singular experience of consciousness, I feel a deep desire to dedicate my life to continuously refining my way of thinking and my understanding of the world - so that I might live this lifetime more meaningfully and with a clearer sense of purpose.

Areas that I resonate with the most are metaphysics and ethics.
