## Music

Music has always been a big part of my life - whether I’m performing, listening, or creating. I’ve been playing the piano for as long as I can remember (though, admittedly, not always practicing consistently... \*\*shame\*\*), and I also play the guitar and violin casually. Much like books, I see music as a timeless bridge between generations - a way for people to preserve their thoughts, emotions and souls, while also connecting with others on a deeper, intuitive level.

My music taste is pretty eclectic, but I listen to rock, classical, and pop the most (in that order). That said, I have a deep fascination with all genres and enjoy exploring music from every corner of the world. Growing up, **The Beatles** left the most lasting impression on me, alongside my childhood favorite, **ABBA**. My favorite composer is **Chopin**, whose musicality and emotional expressiveness never fail to move me. I’ve especially enjoyed the interpretations of his works by **Krystian Zimerman** and **Đặng Thái Sơn**. I’m especially drawn to artists with a strong sense of individuality - those who create music that feels deeply personal, reflecting their identity and speaking to who they are. Over the years, I’ve also consistently enjoyed music from a wide range of artists and composers, including **Pink Floyd**, **Led Zeppelin**, **Eminem**, **Radiohead**, **Beethoven**, **BIGBANG**, **Ngọt**, **Microwave**, **Joe Hisaishi**, **Kenshi Yonezu**, **Jay Chou**, **Wang Fei**, and many more.

Honestly, I could go on forever with music recommendations, but I tried my best to keep it (somewhat) reasonable by picking a couple from each genre lol. Always happy to chat and trade favorites with fellow music lovers!
