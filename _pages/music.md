## Music

Music has always been one of the biggest part of my life - whether it's performing, listening, or creating. I’ve been playing the piano for as long as I can remember (though, admittedly, not always practicing consistently... *\*shame\**), and I also play the guitar and violin casually. Much like books, I see music as a way for musicians to preserve their thoughts, emotions and souls through the ages, and in this way, it serves as a lasting imprint of human creativity and civilization as we evolve throughout history. Engaging deeply with music also allow people to connect with their inner intuitions and emotions, while bonding with others through a universal language. When someone creates or performs music, it offers a rare window into their inner world, allowing us to glimpse their souls, even if they are a complete stranger.

My music taste is pretty eclectic, but I listen to rock, classical, and pop the most. That said, I have a deep fascination with all genres and enjoy exploring music from every corner of the world. I’m highly drawn to artists with a strong sense of individuality - those who create music that feels deeply personal and reflects their identity and expresses their inner soul.
