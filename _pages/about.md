Hello. My name is My Le. You ruined my sleep schedule. Prepare to be cited.

I am a B.S./M.S. student at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), advised by Prof. [Soumya Ray](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T3Wxu_AAAAAJ&hl=en), and formerly, Prof. [Zonghe Chua](https://zonghe-chua.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in **robot learning and planning**, with the goal of developing robots that are **generalizable, scalable, and data-efficient** - capable of learning autonomously and assisting humans in everyday life. This interest stems from a deep fascination with understanding how human reasoning and decision-making work, alongside the challenge of recreating human-like intelligence and capabilities in artificial agents. In the past, I have conducted research in **robotics**, **machine learning**, and **neuroscience**; in addition, I am also drawn to **cognitive science** and **the philosophy of mind**, as I explore the connections between natural and artificial intelligence.
