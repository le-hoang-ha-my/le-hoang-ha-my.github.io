Hello. My name is My Le. You ruined my sleep schedule. Prepare to be cited.

I am a B.S./M.S. student at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), advised by Prof. [Soumya Ray](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T3Wxu_AAAAAJ&hl=en), and formerly, Prof. [Zonghe Chua](https://zonghe-chua.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in **robot learning and planning**, with a strong fascination for understanding how the human brain works. My research lies at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and neuroscience; in addition, I am also drawn to cognitive science and the philosophy of mind.
