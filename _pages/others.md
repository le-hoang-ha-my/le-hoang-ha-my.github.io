## Others

Here are some random fun facts that did not make it into their own section:

- Beyond my core hobbies and interests, I also love dancing (especially hip-hop and contemporary), traveling, parkour, digital art, MOBA and strategy games, and chess - I try to make time for these whenever I can.
- I've been a HUGE fan of Dragon Ball since childhood (hence this page's icon!). I've also really enjoyed other anime series like Hunter x Hunter (2011), Gintama, and Steins; Gate. For manga, I like Monster, Berserk, Pandora Hearts, One Piece, and Goodnight Punpun.
- I wrote my will and testament when I was about 8 years old.
